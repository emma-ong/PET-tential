# Personal Project 1: PET-tential

An app for animals in need of a home. 

Since learning React in Week 4 of EDA bootcamp, I thought it be a good idea
to get more practice and learn some more new features (not limited to React) through adopting and modifying code from guides online. 

The guides include the following, and the list will be updated as this app expands: 

Slide show in the homepage

Google maps in the About page

Animal profile cards on the search page

# External APIs - Choose your own adventure!

To get started: 

* Clone this repo

```sh
cd consuming-external-apis
npm install
npm run dev
```

Choose an API to work with, and let's get building! Find your own, or check out this [comprehensive list of options](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

There is a basic API route set up for you - you may wish to use this as a template.

## Things to remember
* Create the functions that make your API calls in `client/api.js`, and call those functions within your React components.
* If you choose an API that enforces CORS, you'll need to consume that API from your server-side, and consume your own API from the client-side.
